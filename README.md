# AI Workshop Environment Check Scripts

This package contains scripts to help you verify that your Windows computer has all the necessary tools installed for the AI workshop.

## üìã Required Tools

The following tools will be checked:

1. **Git** - Version control system
2. **Java JDK** - Java Development Kit (**Required: JDK 17, 21 or higher**)
3. **Maven** - Java project management tool
4. **Python** - Python programming language (**Required: Python 3.12**)
5. **pip** - Python package installer
6. **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime (includes npm)
7. **Docker** - Container platform (optional but recommended)
8. **IDE** - VS Code or IntelliJ IDEA (recommended)

**‚è±Ô∏è Time Required:**
- Check only: ~2 minutes
- Check + Install all tools: 10-15 minutes

### Python Packages
The script will also check for essential Python packages:
- `openai` - OpenAI API client
- `requests` - HTTP library
- `python-dotenv` - Environment variable management

## üöÄ Quick Start - Choose Your Option

**New to workshops?** ‚Üí Start with **Option 1** to see what you need  
**Want it done quickly?** ‚Üí Use **Option 2** for automatic installation  
**Tech-savvy?** ‚Üí Check the Manual Installation section  

---

## üöÄ How to Use

### Option 1: Batch File (Easiest - Check Only)

1. **Double-click** `check-environment.bat`
2. The script will check all required tools
3. A summary report will show what's installed and what's missing
4. Follow the download links provided for any missing tools

**This option only CHECKS your environment - it does not install anything.**

### Option 2: PowerShell Script (Recommended - Check & Install)

This option can automatically install missing tools for you!

#### Step 1: Enable PowerShell Scripts (One-time setup, if needed)

**Note:** You only need this step if you get a "cannot be loaded" error when trying to run the script.

1. Press `Win + X` and select "Windows PowerShell (Admin)" or "Terminal (Admin)"
2. Run this command:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```
3. Type `Y` and press Enter
4. Close PowerShell and proceed to Step 2

#### Step 2: Run the Script

**Method A - Right-click:**
1. Right-click on `check-environment.ps1`
2. Select "Run with PowerShell"
3. If prompted for Administrator access, click "Yes"

**Method B - PowerShell Terminal:**
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Navigate to the script folder:
   ```powershell
   cd "path\to\your\folder"
   ```
   (Replace `path\to\your\folder` with the actual location where you extracted these scripts)
3. Run the script:
   ```powershell
   .\check-environment.ps1
   ```

#### Step 3: Follow the Prompts

- The script will check each tool
- If a tool is missing, it will ask if you want to install it
- Type `Y` for Yes or `N` for No
- The script uses `winget` (Windows Package Manager) to install tools automatically

## üìä What Happens After Running?

1. **Console Output**: You'll see a real-time status of each check
   - ‚úì Green checkmarks = Tool is installed
   - ‚úó Red X = Tool is missing
   - ‚ö† Yellow warning = Optional or needs attention

2. **Log File**: A log file `environment-check-log.txt` will be created in the same folder with details of the check

3. **Installation**: If you chose to install missing tools via PowerShell script, they will be installed automatically

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### After Installation
**Please restart your terminal/PowerShell** after installing any tools for the changes to take effect.

### Winget Requirement
The PowerShell automatic installation feature requires `winget` (Windows Package Manager), which is included in Windows 11 and Windows 10 (version 1809 or later). If you're on an older version of Windows, you'll need to install tools manually.

### Manual Installation Links

If automatic installation doesn't work, here are the download links:

- **Git**: https://git-scm.com/download/win
- **Java (OpenJDK)**: https://adoptium.net/ or https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
- **Maven**: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
- **Python**: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- **Node.js**: https://nodejs.org/
- **Docker Desktop**: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
- **VS Code**: https://code.visualstudio.com/
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/

### Installing Python Packages

After Python and pip are installed, you can install required packages by running:

```bash
pip install openai requests python-dotenv
```

Or install them one by one:
```bash
pip install openai
pip install requests
pip install python-dotenv
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Script cannot be loaded" Error (PowerShell)
If you get an error about execution policy:
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
3. Try running the script again

### "winget not found" Error
If you get a "winget not found" error:
1. Make sure you're on Windows 10 (1809+) or Windows 11
2. Update Windows to the latest version
3. Install the "App Installer" from Microsoft Store: [Install App Installer](ms-windows-store://pdp/?productid=9NBLGGH4NNS1)
4. Alternatively, install tools manually using the links provided in the script output

**Checking your Windows version:**
- Press `Win + R`, type `winver`, and press Enter
- You should see version 1809 or higher

### "Access Denied" Error
Make sure you're running the PowerShell script as Administrator:
1. Right-click on `check-environment.ps1`
2. Select "Run with PowerShell"
3. Click "Yes" when prompted for administrator access

### Docker Not Running
If Docker is installed but not running:
1. Open Docker Desktop from the Start menu
2. Wait for it to start (you'll see a whale icon in the system tray)
3. Run the check script again

### Tools Not Found After Installation
If you installed tools but the script still doesn't find them:
1. **Close ALL terminal/PowerShell windows**
2. Open a new terminal/PowerShell window
3. Run the check script again
4. If still not working, **restart your computer**
5. The tools should now be available

### Internet Connection Issues
If installation fails with network errors:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Disable VPN if you're using one
3. Try installing tools manually from the provided links
4. Check if your firewall/antivirus is blocking downloads
